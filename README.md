# üíª Multimodal AI Agent

This repository contains a sophisticated, multi-modal AI agent built as a Telegram bot. The agent leverages the power of Google's Gemini Pro to offer a rich, interactive experience, including conversational AI, personal journaling with deep analysis, and optical character recognition (OCR).

## Key Features

- **Multi-Modal Interaction**: Communicate with the bot using text, voice, or images. The bot intelligently processes each input type to provide the appropriate response.
- **Three Core Modes**:
    - **ü§ñ Chatbot Mode**: Engage in open-ended conversations with a powerful AI.
    - **üìì Journal Mode**: A private and secure space to record your thoughts.
        - **AI-Powered Analysis**: Receive insights into your journal entries, including sentiment, key topics, and thematic categories.
        - **Mind Map Visualization**: Get a `graphviz`-generated mind map that visually represents the core themes of your entry.
        - **Daily Prompts**: Opt-in to receive daily prompts to inspire your journaling practice.
    - **üìÑ OCR Mode**: Extract text from any image with high accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
    - **Display Name**: Personalize your experience by setting a custom display name.
    - **Command-Based Navigation**: Easily switch between modes and access features with simple commands.
- **Token Tracking**: Monitor your Gemini API token usage with a dedicated command.
- **Persistent Storage**: All user data, journal entries, and feedback are securely stored in a local SQLite database.

## How It Works

The bot is built with Python and leverages several key libraries:

- **`python-telegram-bot`**: For all interactions with the Telegram API.
- **`google-generativeai`**: To integrate with the Gemini Pro model for all AI-powered features.
- **`SQLite`**: For data storage.
- **`Graphviz`**: To generate mind map visualizations of journal entries.
- **`Pillow`**: For image processing.

The bot's architecture is centered around a `ConversationHandler` that manages the user's state (i.e., which mode they are in). When a user sends a message, the bot processes the input, routes it to the appropriate mode's logic, and generates a response.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    You will also need to install Graphviz. You can find installation instructions for your operating system here: [https://graphviz.org/download/](https://graphviz.org/download/)

3.  **Set up your environment variables**:
    - Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
    - Add your Telegram Bot Token and Gemini API Key to the `.env` file like this:
        ```
        TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
        GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the bot**:
    ```bash
    python New_Main.py
    ```
2.  **Interact with the bot on Telegram**:
    - Open Telegram and search for your bot.
    - Send the `/start` command to begin.
    - Use the inline buttons to select a mode.
    - Start chatting, journaling, or sending images for OCR!

## Commands

- `/start`, `/mode`, `/changemode`: Start the bot and select a mode.
- `/setusername <name>`: Set your display name.
- `/tokens`: Check your Gemini API token usage.
- `/feedback <message>`: Send feedback to the developers.
- `/enableprompts`: Enable daily journal prompts.
- `/disableprompts`: Disable daily journal prompts.
- `/end`: End the current session.
