Abhay,835915433,2025-04-29,18:26:37,"While I enjoyed the foosball game, I've been feeling lazy since this morning, and that continued throughout the day. I feel less energetic than usual.  At the end of the day, I'm usually not this low on energy.  But I'm feeling very tired, with a slight pain in my eyes and body.  So, I feel my body is telling me to rest.

Therefore, today I'm not going to work on any AI assignments. I'm going to take a break, sleep, and get eight hours of proper sleep. It's close to midnight, so the plan is to sleep in the next twenty minutes. Maybe I'll read a few pages in a book, but that might make me drowsy.

I have two more working days before my holiday, and I'm excited about that!  I have many things coming up next week. I need to get my solar panel installed—that's a priority. Tomorrow, I need to talk to my vendor. If he's not going to deliver it, I'll have to change vendors because I need it installed next week.

Shopping-wise, I'm almost done, but I have to pack tomorrow. Packing is something I don't enjoy, but I have to do it.  I also need to wash my clothes before I go; I can't take dirty clothes home.  So, tomorrow I'll put all the clothes I'm taking in the washing machine, get them dry by Thursday, and start packing. Thursday is off, which is a good advantage because I'm leaving early Saturday morning.  Friday, I'll be working late, so I need to do all the packing on Thursday.  Then, Friday evening, I'll check my packing list one last time and leave.

Overall, I'll see what Gemini's sentiment analysis provides.  I know how I'm feeling, but this time I'll review Gemini's output and recommendations.

Abhay,835915433,2025-04-29,18:32:05,"Okay. So, I just gave a three-minute audio input, and no Gemini was able to properly transcribe it and provide advice.  However, the mind map was not generated. I'm not sure why.  Dot craft output came to me, which usually shouldn't happen. It only goes to craft ways for mind map processing.  Yeah. So, this is another diary entry—let's see if this is working. I'll try to cover my sentiments here.

Overall, I am fatigued and tired because I've been consistently sleeping late and waking up early.  I think bringing back a regular sleep schedule—sleeping early, waking up, and getting eight hours of sleep—would help me cope with this fairly soon. I think if I sleep eight hours today, I'll start feeling better tomorrow, and then I can continue working on my AI assignments.

I also have to look for a course. I completed the prompt engineering course on Adex and received the certification.  I also need to look for some other certifications. I found a course that's interesting, but it doesn't offer certification. So, I'm thinking: should I do a course without certification, or should I go for a certification?  Sometimes you just add it to your resume. Does it matter? I need to determine that. But I think the idea should be to start a course and, if I'm not enjoying it later, I can switch.

Otherwise, if I talk about how I'm feeling now in life, I'm feeling fine. It's an exciting time; I'm going home to my wife and child. So, it's definitely exciting. I'm going to attend a wedding—more excitement! But yes, as Gemini mentioned earlier, there's stress regarding the planning of the upcoming holiday.

It's going to be a hectic day because tomorrow is a holiday, and Friday is the next working day. After that, I'll be on holiday.  So, there's a lot of sign-off I need to get. I'll be working towards that.  Yeah, and the football table is broken, so I won't be able to play football at the office today. But that's work, right?  Eventually, we have to do it.

Abhay,835915433,2025-04-30,06:23:57,"Well, tomorrow's a holiday.  So, I have two main tasks: packing and working on the Journal Bot.

Packing will probably take three or four hours.  For the Journal Bot, I need to add two features: a daily thought prompt and a weekly gratitude challenge.

The daily thought prompt will send an automated notification asking, ""How do I feel about today?""  This should encourage me to make entries.  The weekly gratitude challenge will ask me to list three things that went well and three things that didn't.  Again, this is designed to encourage journaling.

Finally, I need to tie everything back to the sentiment analysis, where Gemini will review my thoughts.

So, those are my two major tasks for tomorrow.  The good news is that the bot has been running continuously on PythonAnywhere for the last 30 hours or so.  I also need to check if I can access PythonAnywhere on my mobile.  If the bot goes offline, I want to be able to trigger it and run the script from my phone.

At the start of the day, I came back feeling very motivated.  I planned to pack and work on some board development. But then I started getting tired and procrastinated. I wasted three or four hours doing nothing or doom-scrolling on Facebook. This made me very irritated.  Wasting time irritates me, and that's exactly what happened. I was very irritated until evening. I was under continuous stress, partly because of a conflict with the vendor about a solar panel delivery.

Eventually, the solar panel arrived.  This made me feel relaxed because at least one of the things I wanted to complete today was done. I also finally put my clothes in the laundry (after procrastinating, again!). Then I watched a match. I enjoyed it; I made a fantasy team, but I didn't win—I came last in most contests.  However, my friend Amit did really well, so it was interesting to see his score.

I also watched a movie—a very good Bollywood movie called *Kahaani*. It was very good, and I really enjoyed it. I just finished the movie, so now I'm feeling very good, positive, and energetic.

I also have to test the access management feature.  Now, a deletion should trigger a request to me, and only after I approve it should people be able to use the bot. So, yeah, let's see.

I had a good breakfast before the flight, and even managed a 10-20 minute nap during the flight.  I watched the movie *Lucknow Central*, which was good, and the snacks and beverages on the flight were also enjoyable.  The bus ride from the airport to Vadodara was comfortable as well.

The first day, I missed the office. I didn't go in because I was exhausted from my week-long holiday, and I just wasn't in the mood.  Otherwise, things are good. I'm here with my wife and baby.

Nothing major happened—nothing as crazy as it used to be during my college or school days.  It was a normal day. In fact, I went to work; I didn't take the day off. I worked for a couple of hours and then took my wife and kid out to a fine-dining restaurant. We had a very good dinner; I really enjoyed it.

I got a call from my family. Everyone wished me a happy birthday, even my nephews! They called and spoke at length, sending a video as well.  It was all very good; I enjoyed it immensely.  And this was the first time I'd taken my kid to a restaurant.  It's a nice feeling, a very different feeling, something that can't be easily explained.

I'm spending more time with my kids and wife, and haven't had a chance to work on other things. However, I'm still following recent developments in AI. I know what's happening with ASR, and it's absolutely crazy! I think all the LLMs will significantly increase their efficiency once they implement the ASR training mode.

So, recent developments are good, and I'm thinking I'll create a gem. Gems are very handy on Gemini, so I can use it more frequently.  I also think I'll create an annotator model using the annotator workflow, because this Python bot is good. It's very robust, but it keeps stopping.  I either need to purchase a Python Anywhere premium subscription, which I don't want to do—it's just for fun, so I'll have to see.

I also wanted to make further upgrades to this bot, but I haven't had the time.  I'm hoping this weekend, at least, I'll add one or two new updates. I need to keep using it; otherwise, I won't be able to make any changes.  I might end up making a dictation bot in Gemini, using Gemini as well, because that's something I can use for messaging and other things.

Another thing would be to add a daily prompt.  This would encourage users to make entries on a daily basis.  Currently, users aren't getting prompted, so they aren't entering as much data.

Phase two, of course, has a lot—uh, you know—such as query functionality allowing users to query their journals, letting them download them, and getting better mind maps.
